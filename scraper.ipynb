      "\n",
      "Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have secured a historic agreement with El Salvador‚Äôs President Nayib Bukele that will allow the U.S. to deport violent criminals‚Äîregardless of nationality‚Äîto serve their sentences in El Salvador‚Äôs high-security mega-prison. This bold initiative will cut prison costs, reduce overcrowding, and enhance public safety by removing dangerous criminals from U.S. soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics argue that the U.S. cannot deport American citizens, but federal law provides clear pathways for this policy to be implemented legally. Under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1227, lawful permanent residents can be deported for aggravated felonies, drug offenses, and crimes of moral turpitude. \n",
      "\n",
      "8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1481 allows the revocation of citizenship for naturalized citizens who engaged in terrorism, treason, or fraud in obtaining their status, meaning gang members who concealed their affiliations‚Äîsuch as MS-13 or Tren de Aragua‚Äîcould be stripped of citizenship and removed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the International Prisoner Transfer Program (18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4100-4115) already allows for foreign nationals convicted in the U.S. to serve sentences in their home countries. This new agreement expands that concept by allowing El Salvador to house criminals from any nation, including those the U.S. wants to remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bukele has already transformed El Salvador from one of the world‚Äôs deadliest nations to one of its safest by jailing over 83,000 gang members. His 40,000-inmate mega-prison, Cecot, has become a model for tough, no-nonsense incarceration, where criminals are locked down 24 hours a day with no rehabilitation programs or luxuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, instead of spending $35,000 per inmate per year in U.S. prisons, America can outsource these costs to El Salvador at a fraction of the price, with Bukele proposing a flat fee per inmate to sustain his prison system while reducing U.S. expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This agreement also strengthens Trump‚Äôs broader immigration enforcement strategy. The ‚ÄúSafe Third Country‚Äù framework, already in place with Guatemala, will now apply to El Salvador, ensuring that migrants arrested at the U.S. border can be sent there instead of remaining in the U.S. \n",
      "\n",
      "Criminals who illegally enter the U.S. and commit violent offenses will no longer clog up American prisons or be released due to overcrowding‚Äîthey will be swiftly transferred to El Salvador‚Äôs high-security facility. \n",
      "\n",
      "Venezuela has repeatedly refused to take back Tren de Aragua gang members arrested in the U.S., but now, these criminals can be sent to El Salvador‚Äôs prison system instead, removing them from American streets for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump and Rubio‚Äôs plan represents real action where past administrations have failed. For years, liberal policies have allowed criminal gangs to exploit legal loopholes, avoid deportation, and drain taxpayer dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "This agreement closes those loopholes, removes dangerous criminals, and prioritizes law-abiding Americans over those who threaten public safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "With strong legal backing and a clear enforcement mechanism, this deal is a game-changer‚Äîproving once again that Trump and Rubio are willing to take bold steps to protect American citizens.\n",
